You can make requests to admins such as new channels, notifying of spammers or abusive users, or anything else you might need.
You are also welcome to ask for a private PM from an admin if you would like to discuss something privately. 
Admins cover a variety of time zones, don't hesitate to message us. 
If you would rather not message in that channel and would prefer to simply DM an admin, use the sirbot command: `/admin <message>` and whoever is available will follow up with you privately.
